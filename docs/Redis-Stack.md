## Background

Redis is popular as a caching db, but it actually could support more type of DB through extension, this is why Redis Stack 
was built.

- Redis Stack and Dev.to Community are starting a Redis Hackthon, this is why we have this changes,
- To switch data store from Postgres to Redis

## Tech Stacks Change


### todo
- [ ] switch to Redis Stack
- [ ] load test both (Postgres vs Redis Stack) on local machine through k6
- [ ] get a result about it, write down an article about it
- [ ] submit to Redis hackthon 



## Why this repo

I cloned this repo years ago, 
- to keep it away from obvious security issues with robust latest dependency
- to improve the code quality through implement best practice, and upskill myself too
